%   WORK EXPERIENCE SECTION

\begin{rSection}{Work positions}

\begin{rSubsection}{Filemporium}{July 2015 - Present}{Lead Clojure Developer}{Remote via Upwork}
\item Setup temporary deplyoment via docker and dokku
\item Revised architecture in a way that drastically simplified client-side
  state management and allowed live page update of all active user sessions
\item Reengineered project build system using boot (previously leiningen were used).
  Fixed project build time (full recompilation now takes just a couple of minutes
  instead of an hour). Adjusted project code to work with reloaded workflow.
\item Documented project structure, project-specific code conventions, technical decisions, troubleshooting, and Amazon S3 project-specific step-by-step configuration guide
\item Implemented production-ready multiserver setup with zero-downtime deployment using NixOS/NixOps and Consul
\item Refactored most of the project, implemented lots of functionality and fixed lots of bugs (e.g added
  config schema validation, cleaned up garbage logging (like {\tt (println "!!! FOO:" x)}) and implemented
  propper configurable logging throughout the system, implemented chunked file upload with automatic reconnection, etc.)
\item Interviewed potential candidates
\item Regularly did code reviews
\item Did pair programming (to assist others with complicated tasks, to share project knowledge, to get
  back on track when I'm stuck)
\item Fired a programmer that have been writing terrible code
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Filemporium}{May 2015 - July 2015}{Clojure Developer}{Remote via Upwork}
\item Automated design updates
\item Added compile-time template checks to kioo templating library to ensure
  component correctness after design update
\item Added support for using arbitrary npm libraries from ClojureScript code (to be
  able to utilize existing js React components)
\item Started writing project documentation. Documented actions needed to setup
  a project, update design, add npm library

  \smallskip
  \begin{list}{$\cdot$}{\leftmargin=0em} % \cdot used for bullets, no indentation
    \itemsep -0.5em \vspace{-0.5em} % Compress items in list together for aesthetics
  \item I decided to tie my work to computers when I was 5.
  \item First program in BASIC at age of 11, first HTML and JavaScript at 12, first program in Pascal at 13.
  \item I started playing with Linux when I was 14 (it was Mandrake 10 in 2005)
  \item I use Dvorak keyboard layout
  \item I use Archlinux with lots of handwritten scripts and i3 tiling window manager as my work environment.
  \item I tend to automate everything I could.
  \item I started using Emacs at 2010 and never looked back. Since 2011 I use it with Evil (vim emulation layer)
  \item I have dozens of personal opensource projects and have contributed to
        upstream of at least 20 other.
  \item Some time ago I was passionate about japanese animation, so I learned
        some japanese and passed an international exam (JLPT4 certificate). I remember myself
        learning Esperanto and Toki Pona, and now I am learning Lojban.
  \item I am an active ACM and ACM SIGPLAN member.
  \item One of my primary interests is programming languages. I am still thinking of one
        that would be perfectly expressive. I have plans for PhD in that field.
  \item I write tests very rarely and when I feel I wish to write one, I know that
    I should search for more simple solution that will be obviously working and not
    require any iterative validation. I do not believe that writing tons
    of tests may lead to good system design. More often it leads to design that is hard to change
    in any meaningful way. Instead of going test-first I go think-first, and don't start writing
    code until I clearly know what I'm going to write and why.
